Oververse v0.18
Procedurally-generated roguelike adventure! (Prototype)

An experimental prototype in development:

Delve into the cavernous depths of limitless biomes and sprawling passageways as you battle vile monsters that crawl and fly. Loot precious treasures, amass wealth and accrue experience to get stronger. Try to survive, or die trying! Your goal is to find the legendary "Oververse" at the dungeon's bottom. Inspired by roguelikes such as Angband and NetHack.

Credits: Designed in Twine, Sugarcube, and Tweego. Navigation System based on Dan Cox's video Creating a Dungeon Crawler.  Level Generation uses Alexandre Charoy's Random Walk Map . Uses HiEv's Universal Inventory System and Chapel's Meter Macro, Keyboard Driven Twining.
